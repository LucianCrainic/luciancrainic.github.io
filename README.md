# Lucian D. Crainic portfolio website
> A simple portfolio that i made to show my resume and also share my photography and book reading passion. Website is not intended to share any CS
> projects, i only use GitHub to share/publish any code that i produce. The portfolio website is a way of showing a little of myself outside the CS world
and also my experiences.

Website is made with  <img alt="HTML" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white" />
